<p>The Legend of Korra</p>

<h3 id="how-did-i-get-interested-in-legend-of-korra">How Did I Get Interested In Legend Of Korra?</h3>
<p>This summer, I had the sudden urge to rewatch Avatar: The Last Airbender, but one of my friends told me to watch Legend Of Korra instead since it was a sequel to Avatar, and I haven’t watched Korra yet. I felt like it was a pretty good idea since I already knew what was going to happen in Avatar, and Korra would be a new show for me to watch, but in the same universe as Avatar.</p>

<h4 id="season-1">Season 1</h4>
<p>Korra, who is part of the Southern Water Tribe, is eagered to learn airbending and decides to go to Republic City and go train with Tenzin (Aang’s son). Whilst Korra was in Republic City, Korra gets introduced to Mako, a fire bender and Bolin, an earth bender, 2 pro benders on the Fire Ferrets, and later joins the pro bending team. Mako meets his first love, Asami, through an accident, who is the daughter of the large business in Republic City called Future Industries. Mako expresses to Asami that the Fire Ferrets are in desperate need of money or they’ll be out of the tournament, so Asami’s father, Hiroshi Sato spoonsers the team and gives them enough money to continue competing in the tournament. <br /><br /></p>

<p>However, Korra’s arrival was not expected. There is a group called the Equalists in Republic City whose main goal is to remove everyone’s bending in Republic City to make Republic City equal. How exactly will the Equalists take their bending away? Apparently, their leader, Amon, was gifted powers from the spirits to take peoples bending away. A councilman hears word of this, and disapproves of the notion, so councilman Tarloc creates a secret force to try to capture and kill Amon, but fails horribly. With all of the dangers in mind, the councilmen approve that the pro bending final match still occurs. Unfortunately, during the Fire Ferrets final match, Amon suddenly shows up to the stadium and attacks all the guards and benders. We find out that a person on Team Avatar’s side (Korra, Mako, Bolin, and Asami) is working for the equalists, and we also find out that there are 2 bloodbenders on the loose, who exactly is working for the equalists? Who are the 2 bloodbenders on the loose? Will Team Avatar be able to defeat Amon?</p>

<h4 id="season-2">Season 2</h4>
<p>Team Avatar, who consist of Korra, Mako, Asami, and Bolin, and Tenzin’s family travel to the Southern Water Tribe, but is rudely welcomed by an evil spirit from the spirit world. Luckily, the group is saved by Unalaq, who is the leader of the Northern Water Tribe. Whilst seeing how Unalaq tames the spirits, Korra suddenly decides to train with Unalaq because Unalaq would be a better mentor than Tenzin. Frustrated, Tenzin leaves the Southern Water Tribe to go to the Air temple with his family. Upon Unalaq’s request, Team Avatar and Unalaq’s team go to the south pole in order to open one of 2 spirit portals, which allow anyone to go in and out of the spirit world. Going back to the Southern Water Tribe, Korra discovers that Unalaq’s Northern Water Tribe members are there to take over the Southern Water Tribe culture. Furthermore, Unalaq arrests Korra’s father, and many other Southern Water Tribe members from trying to allegedly assassinate him. Eventually, Team Avatar frees all of the Southern Water Tribe members locked in prison, and promises the United Republic to support them in order to fight the Northern Water Tribe. <br /><br /></p>

<p>While going to the fire nation for help, she encounters a dark spirit, and later wakes up on a beach with amnesia. Whilst Korra is being healed by the fire benders through spirit water, Korra explores her past lives and learns about Avatar Won, the first Avatar. 10,000 years ago, humans lived on giant turtles that grant humans temporary bending powers in order for humans to hunt for food and protect themselves from spirits. Avatar Won broke the rules about bringing bending into his village and was banished, but the giant turtle allowed Won to keep his fire bending for survival. Whilst traveling, Won encounters 2 powerful spirits in war, and accidentally helps the evil one escape, Vaatu. Rava, the other spirit, explains to Won that she is the spirit of light and peace, and Vaatu is the spirit of evil and darkness. Rava explains to Won that Vaatu is preparing for Harmonic Convergence where Vaatu and Rava fight for the fate of the world. Before Harmonic Convergence, Rava and Won travel to the different turtles, and learns all 4 powers of bending. During Harmonic Convergence, Won and Rava fuse permanently, making the first avatar and locking Rava up in the Tree of Time. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Unalaq wants to open both spirit portals to free Vaatu, which is the reason why Unalaq forced Korra to open one of the 2 portals. Eventually, Unalaq frees Vaatu and they combine as one, becoming a dark spirit Avatar. In their first encounter, Unalaq defeatsa Korra, and sucks Rava out of her (which means she cannot go into the Avatar state), and disconnects Korra from being able to contact her past lives, thus capturing Rava. Finally, once Korra is defeated, Unalaq enters the physical world and tries to destroy Republic City. However, Korra finds another spirit within her, and enters the physical world in order to stop the dark spirit Avatar Unalaq. Who will win in the physical world between Korra and Unalaq? Will Korra eventually be able to reconnect with her past lives? Will Korra get the chance to reunite with Rava and use the Avatar state again?</p>

<h4 id="season-3">Season 3</h4>
<p>Due to Harmonic Convergence, we see humans and spirits co-exist in the real world. Also due to Harmonic Convergence, it gave random people the power of air bending. However, a very dangerous person, Zaheer, was granted the power of air bending and escaped prison with his newfound powers. Zaheer then goes to the other 3 nations to save his old gang members, Ghazan, the lava bender, Ming-Hua, the water bender, and P’li, the combustion bender. They are called the red lotus and their goal is to kill the Avatar to restore balance. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Korra finds out that there are new airbenders, and travels all around the Earth Kingdom to find air benders. Whilst arriving in Ba Sing Sae, Korra figures out that the Earth Queen and the Dai Li are up to no good – capturing air benders to force them to fight for the Earth Queen, and make a super air bender army. Korra and her team eventually save the air benders from the Earth Kingdom, and Tenzin takes the air benders to the northern air temples to train them whilst Korra’s group goes to Zaofu to find more air benders. In Zaofu, tension arises between BeiFong and Suyin (Toph’s daughters), due to their rocky past. However, the 2 sisters eventually reconcile. Using the Spirit World, Zaheer finds out where the avatar is, and attempts to kidnap Korra in Zaofu, which fails, but the Red Lotus escapes safely. <br /><br /></p>

<p>Upon failing, Zaheer goes to the Northern Air Temple to take hostage the air benders and Tenzin, to force Korra to the Northern Air Temple. Korra decides to turn herself in to Zaheer in order to save the air benders and Tenzin, however Zaheer double crosses them. Then, many big fights break out, and P’Li eventually dies. With P’Li dying, Zaheer can finally have the ability to fly and ‘enter the void’ and flies away with Korra. The Red Lotus members poison Korra, to force her into the avatar state and kill Korra (this way, it’ll stop the Avatar cycle). Will the Red Lotus be successful in their mission? Will Team Avatar and their squad find Korra in time?</p>

<h4 id="season-4">Season 4</h4>
<p>Season 4 happened 3 years after season 3. Now, there is a new earth empire leader, Kuvera, who is trying to reunite all of the Earth Kingdom through propaganda. We are introduced to Baatar Jr, Suyin’s eldest son, and engaged to Kuvera. Now, Bolin and Varrick are working for Kuvera. <br /><br /></p>

<p>For the past 3 years, Korra has been trying to recover from what happened, and eventually a spirit leads her into the swamp. We are introduced by a familiar face, Toph. Toph tells Korra that there is more poison in her body, and Korra needs to get it out. Eventually, Korra gets the poison out of her, and finally is able to re-enter the Avatar state. <br /><br /></p>

<p>There are 2 places that Kuvira’s army has not reunited, Zaofu and Republic City. All of Kuvira’s army comes to Zaofu, but Suyin disapproves of Kubera’s goal and refuses to join the empire, and eventually, Suyin’s family gets imprisoned. At this point, Bolin and Varrick discover how controlling and bad Kuvera is and tries to escape. However, Varrick is forced to continue the secret ultimate weapon for Kuvera. Bolin and Varrick eventually escape, but Kuvera goes into the swamp to get more spirit vines for the ultimate weapon. Due to Kuvera cutting vines in the swamp,  the spirit vines in Republic city attack people and trapping them. Korra’s past prevents her from entering the spirit world, and visits Zaheer in prison. This helps Korra enter the spirit world, and be able to speak to Rava for the first time. Zaheer decides to help Korra since Zaheer Hates people like Kuvera and helps Korra get into the spirit world, eventually freeing everyone from the spirit vines. Toph and Lin save Suyin and her family, and figures out that Kuvera is planning an attack on Republic City, to take back what was theirs. Asami and Varrick attempt to make mech suits. However, Kuvira’s empire comes to Republic city a week early, with a super cannon and a robot covered in platinum. Nothing seems to work on the outside, however a familiar face comes back to aid defeating the robot. Who is this mysterious person? How will Korra and everyone else defeat this mecha giant? Will Korra be able to defeat Kuvera?</p>

<h3 id="any-flawsdislikes">Any Flaws/Dislikes?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>As for flaws and dislikes, just like most people, I really disliked season 2 of Korra.</li>
  <li>I also felt like there was so much content in season 1, like there were 2 different stories going on, one with Amon and the other with the pro bending tournament.</li>
  <li>I didn’t really like how General Iroh had the same voice as Zuko.</li>
  <li>I didn’t really like Team Avatar that much, it kind of felt like it was randomly assembled during desperate times, but out of those desperate needs, everyone does their own thing.</li>
  <li>Having different villains in different seasons, I feel like it’s less intriguing to the viewers to have a new antagonist every season (but I can see the positives of having multiple antagonists, but it’s just not for me).</li>
  <li>I absolutely hated Prince Wu, I just thought he was annoying to be honest
    <h3 id="final-thoughts-and-grade">Final Thoughts And Grade</h3>
    <p>I would give Legend Of Korra a 7.5/10. There were some weak parts, like season 2 and sort of 4. Overall, I really enjoyed the series though – being really hooked on season 1 and 3. I think that the characters of Korra were decent at best, and the CGI was really noticeably better than Avatar as well. I feel like compared to Avatar, it doesn’t hold up, obviously, but Korra on it’s own, it’s pretty good, but we as viewers also have to keep in mind that Avatar the expectation for Avatar was way lower than Korra’s because Avatar is “One of the best TV shows’’, and Korra had to live up to that expectation, but ultimately, failed, which is not a bad thing, since it is very hard to live up to those expectations. One thing that I enjoyed was the more mature content of Korra compared to Avatar, instead of catering towards younger kids, it feels like it was catered towards teens.  <br /><br /></p>
