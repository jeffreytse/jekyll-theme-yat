<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
We study high-level visual perception in the human brain, with a focus on ecologically relevant and meaningful vision:
how do I know where I am in space? How fast do I and that ball move? ; What emotion does that person feel? Have I not
seen this place/object/person before? Our studies include links to attention, memory and social interactions. We
collaborate with clinicians to gain insights on disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and ADHD.
</p>

<p>
Methodologically we use non-invasive brain imaging (3T and 9.4T fMRI), and we can perturb neural processing using
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), also during fMRI (latest hardware!). For data analysis and modelling we use
multivariate classifiers and old-fashioned stats. Our research questions currently include the following:
</p>

<h2>Illusions, scene segmentation, and attention</h2>

<p>
Illusions allow separating visual processing from visual consciousness, and open windows to processes involved in scene
segmentation, perceptual grouping, Gestalt perception, and reveal prior knowledge. We use primarily bi-stable stimuli
and attention to examine these processes.
</p>

<h2>Natural scenes, motion, and space</h2>

<p>Natural scenes (such as feature movies) are fascinating: they contain most visual input our brain evolved in. We study
the interpretation of high-level motion in movies, but also of people, objects, and space. Using controlled paradigms we
examine how the brain integrates visual signals with body-related signals (efference copies of muscle-movements,
proprioceptive and vestibular signals) to provide perceptual stability. The aim is to understand the brain encodes our
position in the environment, and how it reconstructs the 3D-space and objects around us based on visual input. - Motion,
space, and memory are tightly interlinked.
</p>

<h2>Emotion and social interaction</h2>

<p>
How do we recognise emotional inflections in facial motion, in body posture, or by observing people interact? We study
how dynamic changes of facial expressions and body posture are processed, and how visual and affective brain regions
exchange information.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Stimuli</h3>

<p>
    We use anything from highly controlled stimuli (such as 3D-dotfields), virtual reality, to natural movies. Special
    paradigms such as binocular rivalry and visual illusions allow dissociating pure processing from processing related to
    conscious perception, attentional control and decision making.
</p>

<h3>Patients</h3>

<p>
    We are highly interested in understanding the mechanistic reasons that can lead to neglect, autism, ADHD, or
    schizophrenia. We therefore collaborate with clinicians (Neurologists and Psychiatrists) and examine their patients
    using our paradigms - purely behaviourally or also using fMRI.
</p>

<h3>Brain imaging</h3>

<p>
    fMRI (3T and 9.4T) and EEG. Analyses: we use standard statistics and multivariate approaches to gain insights into
    neural information content.
</p>

<h3>Brain stimulation</h3>

<p>
    TMS. We use neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to disturb perception, attentional processes and
    associated decision making, in order to test the causal involvement of brain regions in a task. Simultaneous TMS-fMRI is
    used to examine neural effects of various TMS protocols using the latest 7-channel surface coils.
</p>

<p>
    Throughout most experiments we use eye tracking (EyeLink or Arrington).
